### Personal Note
I had great fun working on this project, and I am looking forward to hearing from the great folks at Eulerity. I thoroughly explored and read the documentation for styled-components, which turned out to be a fantastic learning experience. It was an exciting challenge that allowed me to showcase my skills in creating dynamic, user-friendly, and interactive web applications.

I believe I would be a great fit for the company and bring valuable experience to the team. Additionally, I live just a two-hour drive from the office, making me an ideal candidate for any hybrid work opportunities.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
